# Eiffel Game 2

A Game library for ISE Eiffel.

This is a library for game development using the Eiffel Language. The library is compatible with the IDE EiffelStudio 16.05 and newer from ISE.

The library is compatible with Linux, macOS & Windows. It should also work with any other operating system (FreeBSD, Android, IOS, etc.), but it is not officially supported.

The Audio and Audio_Sound_File sub-libraries are under the LGPL license. Every other sub-libraries are under the zlib license. Every examples are under the GPL license.

The project uses those libraries: SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_gfx, SDL2_ttf, OpenAL, Libsndfile, libmpg123, GLEW.

## Installation on Linux (Ubuntu)

- I assume that you already have a functional EiffelStudio on your system. If not, install it.
- If you obtained the library sources by cloning the git repository, fetch submodules (run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` in the library folder)
- Rename the library folder (containing this README.md) to `game2`.
- Add the `game2` folder library in the `contrib/library` folder of EiffelStudio. This folder is usually under `/usr/lib/EiffelStudio_XX.XX` or `/usr/local/Eiffel_XX.XX`.
- Install the C libraries SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_gfx, SDL2_ttf, OpenAL, libsndfile, libmpg123, OpenGL, GLU, libepoxy along with their development toolkits and dependencies:

---

    sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-gfx-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libopenal-dev libsndfile1-dev libmpg123-dev libepoxy-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libglew-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libswresample-dev libswscale-dev

---

- Execute the `compile_c_library.sh` script (from the `game2` directory).
- Create a project and add the sub-libraries you need (`.ecf` files) in the project. (You can use the `EIFFEL_LIBRARY` environment variable to add those libraries. For example: `$EIFFEL_LIBRARY/contrib/library/game2/game_core/game_core.ecf`)

Note: If you have a dependency error while running the apt-get command like `libsdl2-dev depending of libgles2-mesa-dev`, install the latest and try this:

---

    sudo apt-get install libgles2-mesa-dev
    sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-gfx-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libopenal-dev libsndfile1-dev libmpg123-dev libepoxy-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libglew-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libswresample-dev libswscale-dev

---

## Installation on Windows

- Note: For an easy installation, see: https://github.com/tioui/Eiffel_Game2/tree/windows_build.
- You must have a working EiffelStudio. If you don't have it already, install it.
- Rename the library folder (containing this README.md) to `game2`.
- Add the `game2` library folder in the `contrib/library` folder of EiffelStudio. This folder is usually under `C:\Program Files\Eiffel Software\`.
- Install the C library dependencies. To get them, download the files at https://github.com/tioui/Eiffel_Game2/raw/windows_build/C_libraries.zip. After extracting them, you should have a C_lib_win directory. Put the C_lib_win directory in the root directory of the Eiffel_Game2 repository.
- Using the "EiffelStudio command prompt" (within your Start menu), execute the `compile_c_library.bat` script in the `game2` directory.
- Create a project and add the libraries you need (`.ecf` files) in the project. (You can use the `EIFFEL_LIBRARY` environment variable to add those libraries. For example: `$EIFFEL_LIBRARY/contrib/library/game2/game_core/game_core.ecf`)
- Put all `.dll` files within `C_lib_win\DLLXX\` in the new project directory or in `C:\Windows\System32\`.
